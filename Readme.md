Challenges Portal
=================

What's my user's experience like?
---------------------------------

```
I'm Greg, a student at Code Platoon.
So I've been working on the challenges.
In order to get better feedback about what challenges
are available and where I'm at, I want to go to the
challenges portal!

Logging in:
  I'll go to the index
  I see some welcome page
  I click the "login" link
  I fill "email" in with "101glover@gmail.com"
  I fill "password" in with "lolhimom"
  I click "Login"

Checking my high level progress
  I'm on my homepage
  I see a list of my challenges
  I see that I've completed the "Linked list challenges"
  I see that I've completed 2 of the 65 "Module Challenges"
  I see that I've not started "ActiveRecord challenges"

Checking my low level progress
  I click on "Module Challenges"
  I see the toplevel groups of namespaces and include challenges
  Within namespace challenges, I have 2 of 17 completed:
    define a module MahMod
    define a module MahMod::A
  Within the include challenges, I have 0 of 48 completed

Somehow I need to be able to submit challenge solutions
  Maybe through travis?

Somehow I need to be able to see everyone else's progress
  Maybe from the homepage?
```


Make my acceptance tests
------------------------

* Get a Rails app up
* Translate the above into Capybara


Start pushing forward on the first one
--------------------------------------

* I predict the failure, see it fail, go move it further


Make unit tests for specific functionality
------------------------------------------

(ie things that can exist independently of Rails requests)
